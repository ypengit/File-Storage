Perl IDE -- Insert code snippets, run and profile the code and look up help
================================================================================
===== detailed description
================================================================================
Perl-Support is written to considerably speed up writing code in a consistent
style, as well as to help with other often performed tasks:

- insert various types of comments
- insert complete but empty statements (e.g. 'if {} else {}' )
- insert often used code snippets (e.g. declarations, the opening of files, .. )
- insert the names of file tests, character classes, special Perl-variables and POSIX-signals
- read, write, maintain your own code snippets in a separate directory
- ... which come in an extendible template library
- run scripts or run syntax check from within the editor
- show compilation errors in a quickfix window
- read perldoc for functions and modules
- run perltidy / run the profiler SmallProf
- test / explain regular expressions (needs Vim with Perl interface)
