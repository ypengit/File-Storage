AWK IDE -- Insert code snippets, run and check the code and look up help
================================================================================
===== detailed description
================================================================================
AWK-IDE for Vim/gVim is written to considerably speed up writing scripts in a
consistent style. This is done by inserting complete statements, idioms, code
snippets, templates, and comments. Compiling and viewing a document, format
conversion and running make can be done with a few keystrokes.

- insert various types of comments
- insert complete but empty statements
- insert often used code snippets
- ... which come in an extendible template library
- run scripts or run syntax check from within the editor
- show compilation errors in a quickfix window
