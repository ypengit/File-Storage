Lua IDE -- Insert code snippets, run and check the code and look up help
================================================================================
===== detailed description
================================================================================
Speed-up the development of Lua scripts:

- insert code snippets: comments, statements, functions, regular expressions, ...
- ... which come in an extendible template library
- quickly comment the code by automatically generating function descriptions
- run or compile the code from within Vim
- run the syntax checker
- quick access to the online reference manual
- ... or read the manual inside Vim
- make integration

The help file online :  http://wolfgangmehner.github.io/vim-plugins/doc/luasupport.html

While this plug-in is conceived as a successor of the original lua-support ( http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=1763 ), backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.
However, we hope that the better configurability through the template library and other new features make for a product which is much better suited to deal with a language like Lua.
