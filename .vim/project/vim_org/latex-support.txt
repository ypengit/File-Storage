LaTeX IDE -- Insert commands, run the typesetter and BibTeX and look up help
================================================================================
===== detailed description
================================================================================
LaTeX-IDE for Vim/gVim is written to considerably speed up typesetting a
document in a consistent style. This is done by inserting complete statements,
idioms, code snippets, templates, and comments. Compiling and viewing a
document, format conversion and running make can be done with a few keystrokes.

- insert complete but empty statements
- insert various types of comments
- insert often used code snippets
- change existing templates, add new templates
- read, write, and maintain your own code snippets in a separate directory
- show compilation errors in a quickfix window
